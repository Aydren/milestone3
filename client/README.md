### Inspiration

The idea for creating this project came to me while realizing how expensive it is to plan a wedding. The stresses of needing to track my expenses was the drive for this project. This project is still in its development stage, as most of the key features I was hoping to add could not make the time constrant.

### Lessons Learned

The purpose of me taking on this assignment alone was to force myself out of my comfort zone and learn through my own struggle and research. My biggest struggles throughout this assignment was backend and data manipulation. The process of actually understanding the backend logic, DB querying, and react hooks that I have utilized throughout my project has given me confidence in the fact that I do understand what I am learning and I am able to implement my understandings to my own projects. I would not hesitate to take on another project alone as the knowledge and skills I have learned over these last 2 weeks have proven to make me a better developer.
